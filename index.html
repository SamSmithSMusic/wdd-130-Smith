        I am currently in a relationship and in my free time I enjoy gaming with friends, listening to music, and driving.<br>
        I hope to use the skills I learn in this class to build my own and friends future websites, as well as develop a further understanding of how websites work on the front and back end.<br>
        My favorite scripture is D&C 121 and I've been a member of the church for my entire life.
