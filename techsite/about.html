            <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
            <p>Samuel Smith founded this company after being stumped on a problem of his own and noticing how much tech help is out there, but how little of it is truly reliable and helpful. He aims to create a tech support environment where users can easily seek quick, reliable, and cost effective information from our experts.</p>
